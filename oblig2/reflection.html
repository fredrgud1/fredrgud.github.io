    <p>I decided to use the picture tag instead of img because it made it a lot easier to swap the image based on the viewport size. Because of the 
        pricture tags properties it can easily change out the image source based on the viewpor, it can also do this with multiple viewport size and 
    images which makes it very usefull. when makeing the website based on the wireframe it took a bit to figure out how to make the images end up 
    where i wanted them when using flex. I ended up spliting the images into groups of three so that i could postion them easier. This let me change the
    the setup easier with felx display. Also postioning the images in realtion to eachother took a bit of finetuning that was timeconsuming. when it came
    to the resiponsive design i had a bit of an issue where the text would overflow wider than the width of the image. This made the website diffrent from 
    the wireframe. I ended up setting the text width to be always smaller than the image so it wouldn't overflow and change the design from the wireframe
    when it responded to the screen size changing. the task was decently diffcult to figure out, but i feel like it gave me challenges that helped me learn
    how to use flexbox  </p>
